Again in 1925, Krishna District was further divided into Krishna and West Godavari Districts. There are no changes in its jurisdiction except some minor changes (in Divi Taluk and Munagala Paragana).

    <p>The spectacular rock-cut caves at Undavalli near Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh are unique. In this cave complex, one can see layers of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence, telling the story of the evolution of faith in the region. These caves were originally excavated through the rock face between the 4th and 5th centuries CE, and served as Buddhist monasteries or viharas for monks. During this time, Amaravathi, located around 35 km away, was a great centre of trade and commerce, attracting merchants from all over the world. </p>
    <h2>Prakasam Barrage</h2>
    <img src="img/prakasambarrage.jpg" alt="Prakasam Barrage" width="400px" height="250px">
    <p>The Krishna anicut with its canals for irrigation and flood banks for the protection of the Krishna delta from the floods was constructed from 1852 to 1855 at a cost of Rs. 2 crores. It was designed by Sir Arthur Cotton and was built by Capt. Orr. The barrage was built to irrigate an ayacut of 5.8 lakh acres.

        Due to development of ayacut in Krishna delta, the anicut was incapable of providing water for irrigation. Since irrigation under river Krishna was developed in the uplands, other states were also fully utilizing the allotted Krishna water. The scenario necessitated construction of a structure, which can head up water 12 ft. above the crest of the anicut to cater to the needs of an ayacut of 13 lakh acres in Krishna, West Godavari, Guntur and prakasam Districts.
        
        Thus, Prakasam Barrage was born. It was named after the great leader Sri Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, the barrage was constructed between 1954 to 1957 and costed Rs. 2.78 crores.
        
        The Krishna River received historic floods during the period 2-10-2009 to 13-10-2009 at Prakasam barrage. The maximum observed flood inflow was 11,10,404 cusecs seen at 11.00. PM on 05-10-2009 which is the highest recorded flood discharge after construction of Prakasam barrage. The previous maximum flood discharge was 9,32,000 cusecs observed during the year 1998.</p>
