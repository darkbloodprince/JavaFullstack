Let’s see what our Mentor has to say about the Interview!

The student has covered only arrays so far and is not yet fully comfortable with the syntax. He still need to study other data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues. Additionally, he require more practice in solving and debugging problems, and need to strengthen their understanding of Java fundamentals and time complexity concepts.For the two questions provided, student came up with the brute force approach and for implementing brute force also he was getting multiple errors.
